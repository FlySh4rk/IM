# Models

## Initial attempts

- `first_model`
- `first_model_compile`
- `first_model_compile3`
- `second_model`
- `second_model_no_perm`

These are the preliminar models which only take in consideration 2d data and generated from random
values. The solution used to train the network is generated algorithmically.

## Final Model : `model_v4_train`

This is the model adapted to 3d then trained and validated with the collected data.
